# YeGuoMa
Final project by Janice Ye, Xuancheng Guo, Yuteng Ma
We first find the topic of the project around the beginning of April, then we form a group and reach verbal commitment about our MOU
Then, we start our first round of brainstorming on how to tackle this project in the following weeks
We first start writing the program around Apr. 20th
Xuancheng (Jerry) Guo is in charge of the first round of coding
Ma and Janice are in charge of debugging and report context writing
Here is a link to the shared Google doc for the first couple of rounds of our report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQXzeGbJvksEMuefeWPnkzwSFHEwXY49jaVvh7vaBVg/edit?usp=sharing
Specifically, Ma found different sources and reasoning for the wildfire, and Janice drafted the report for the team to review
We finished our project and added a table of contents in Apr. 28th
